# ProjectAfya

COVID-19 has devastated the world, killing over 200,000 and infecting millions. We have witnessed the virus completely overwhelm the healthcare systems in New York, Italy, and many other countries throughout the world. While some of us might think we've seen the worst of this virus, the WHO and many similar organizations have warned that a vast majority of deaths could come from Africa, as there are very few hospitals and physicians. The UN wrote that “more than a half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa do not meet the minimum acceptable physician-to-population ratio of 1-per-5,000 WHO standard”. Imperial College London reported that as per their models, over a million people in Africa could die in the worst case scenario.

To aid health systems in Africa, we (our team) founded Afya as part of a global hackathon to strengthen health systems in Africa. We are a seven member team from 6 different countries who are committed to the development of accessible, area-specific solutions to strengthen healthcare in Africa. Our team is from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from development to medicine to social entrepreneurship. 

We plan on strengthening health systems in rural Africa by empowering Community Health Workers (CHWs) through providing them with access to information.

# Who are Community Health Workers and how have they helped in past epidemics?
Community health workers are trained members of the community who are the first point of contact for health care in most communities around Africa and are responsible for health information dissemination, help curb disease outbreaks, and in previous pandemics e.g. HIV/AIDS, Ebola, etc. They have also helped improve maternal service provision, immunization coverage and help buffer health systems in their community. CHWs are credited with the containment and treatment of the Ebola epidemic. Overall, CHWs are key to any plan to strengthen health systems, as they are often the only healthcare contact that people have. Project Afya is intended to empower CHWs living in rural Africa and help them through their daily struggles.

# Struggles CHWs Face
1. Many CHWs don't know many symptoms of COVID-19, due to them having trouble accessing that information.
2. During this time, many ineffective and often harmful treatments have emerged. For example, many people have drank salty water or eaten garlic because they had consumed "fake news" that told them it was a treatment. Unfortunately, many CHWs don't have access to information that could debunk this. The language barrier worsens this, as even if information is easily available, CHWs are unable to consume the information.
Overall, the inaccessibility of important information hinders CHWs responding to this crisis.

# Afya, Our Solution
To fight this problem, we developed Afya, an AI powered chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing to answer questions that CHWs have about COVID-19. We are planning on deploying Afya on three platforms. First, we will use SMS messaging as this is accessible to people who don't have access to smartphones. Second, we plan on deploying this as a WhatsApp bot, as WhatsApp is the most commonly used app in Africa, and WhatsApp is heavily subsidized in many countries, making it cheaper than SMS. Third, we plan on having robocalls which a user can request if they are illiterate or if they have low-vision. We are launching beta testing for Afya today, on May 3rd, and we hope to raise funds to allow us to scale this up.
